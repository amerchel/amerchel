Hi 👋 My name is Adrianna
=========================

👩🏻‍💻 I currently work in the IT department of a large company, where my servicedesk work allows me to face a variety of technical challenges on a daily basis. Solving user problems gives me great satisfaction, and the knowledge I gain allows me to grow in the world of technology.

📚 After hours I'm a student of computer science, I'm learning new programming languages, exploring computer networks and experimenting with different technologies. 

🎮 In my free time I disappear into the virtual world, playing computer games. This is not only a way for me to relax, but also a field for learning, testing new skills and gaining experience. 

🔍 My repositories on GitHub are where I post my progress made in my studies and from additional courses. In the future, projects of my own experiments will also appear here



*   ⚡  I'm a huge fan of MARVEL
